TAKEN SCENARIO: I am imagining 500 to 1000 visiter come to my site daily

Problem:
- How to match two user to start gameplay in optimized way?
- How to continuouly try to match two player in case player number is sufficient at that period and try again and again?
- How to decide and implemented which will get what side?
- Should i maintain game state state for each user on server also?
- How to handle connection lost problem, if one of lost connetion while game is going?
-


Handling random user palying game :
-let make a waitingquee to push each player when they connected to websocker
- Then if quee contain yetLeast two user we join them ,if no we add timer logic to check continuouly for matching them from 1 min max ,if fail will send terminate then websocket connetion.
- For MatchPlayer i will  send the data in joinquee which contain  gameid and then send them gameid to client
- On each message we check send paramter and communicated them based on there gameid
